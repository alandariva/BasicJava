BasicJava
==================================================

BasicJava is a Java like language interpreter in JavaScript.

Why? It was part of my undergraduate final project about learning Java programming 
in a virtual reality environment. I used this interpreter to execute code and let 
the user write code in an virtual reality environment.

I didn't try to compare performance of this implementation with compiled Java, 
but for sure this interpreter is VERY slow in comparison with Java.
